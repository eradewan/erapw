> I wrote some random reflections and some observations of my time at MIT on the plane back from Boston. I was only there for 3 days, so these are first impressions.

## MIT Culture

### Good things

1. The MIT vocabulary goes strong: psets, hosed, numbers for everything (majors & buildings). You know a culture is strong when conversations are complete gibberish to people outside.
2. It’s so funny to see the same things at your university but branded slightly different (MIT Police, MIT Hillel, MIT SAAS, etc). It’s like copy paste. 
3. MIT PE requirement is so fun (archery, guns, yoga, ballroom dancing) - good and chill seminar types to kind of expand world view situations, but also keeps you active.
4. Dorm culture is so cute! People actually participate and get to know each other. It’s so nice to see people from all years get together. It’s really ~college.
5. Another random thing I liked is the nerd culture. Like jokes about CS and math everywhere (on whiteboards, flyers, etc.). Lots of references to Pi and famous math and chemistry formulas. There is pride surrounding being a nerd. 
6. Other random things I liked: hacking (doing illegal things), beef between houses (so funny), study breaks, point system (so smart)
7. Sights to see: banana room, infinite (hella long hallway), murals, tunnels (chairing - when you roll down the tunnels in a chair…but we couldn’t find a chair), lots of great study spaces, MIT museum (rip it closed before I could go but it looked cool)

### Some eh things

1. These problem sets seem to be on a different level of difficulty. No thank you. 
2. Why do people not sleep?? Like they actually don’t sleep.
3. They have 30 minute break between classes. I thought Penn’s 15 minutes was annoying, but 30 minutes would piss me off.
5. My friend told me some people don’t do the cool things (like the more fun PE classes) or do economics for their humanities concentration (instead of something actually humanities) because they want an easier class or something more useful. This is kinda sad but expected. Every school has these people so not surprised. 
6. I swear everyone and their dog has worked at Jane Street? 

Overall: Amazing school. I’m sold. I love it. I don’t think I’d fit in, but I still like it a lot. Maybe I’ll apply for grad school for fun.

## Boston

Boston is such a great city. I’m so confused - why don’t people talk about it like NYC sand SF? The vibes are very intellectual. The first coffee shop we walk into and some guys are arguing about significant digits. Lots of old rich people walking around. The T transportation is really easy to learn. Nature is very nice. The Boston Common and Public Garden area was such a vibe. Having the Charles river and skyline view right outside the dorms is so pretty, especially in the morning. The weather was really nice all the days I was there, so winter may be a different story.

Another thing that stood out was the architecture. Boston has great building designs. Stata building was so cool to see in person. They also have like jenga-like buildings, domes, columns, and flat-iron type shapes. Boston buildings come in different shapes and sizes so it makes for a very interesting skyline.

## Random

1. Engineers & Art: So many engineers are good at art. An astounding amount. By “art” I don’t  mean being trained to use mediums like charcoal and oil paint. I mean a lot of engineers have their own style of doodling and drawing random things (shoutout Gaby D). The white boards, dorms, and walls of MIT are  full of different styles of art and doodles. East Campus’s dorm hallways are so cool.
2. My friend and I met some rich MIT alumni in front of the dome. 
3. I got 1 stick of the famous Japanese chalk (Hagoromo). [reference](https://gizmodo.com/why-mathematicians-are-hoarding-this-special-type-of-ja-1711008881)
4. Boston cannolis were so good. [reference](https://www.instagram.com/mikespastry/?hl=en)
