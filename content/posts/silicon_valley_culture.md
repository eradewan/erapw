I recently read [Uncanny Valley](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/?fbclid=IwAR1IU5PVcJcrwXrQkt33F8ODsbO5XduYpvt4oNYyab8YtWguIzEXphcRyzM) by Anna Weiner. It reminds me of another article on medium: [This is Silicon Valley](https://onezero.medium.com/this-is-silicon-valley-3c4583d6e7c2) by Gloria Liou. Both articles expose the hypocrisy and toxicity that are deeply ingrained in Silicon Valley technology and startup culture. They both have a similar strategy of juxtaposing the shiny perks with the darker side. Both authors were women that worked at technology companies, and they both eventually left the Valley.

Although I resonated with both articles, I am a little disappointed that they both left. I don’t judge them for their decisions because it was a personal choice. On a macro level, if everyone who experiences an issue leaves to escape, there is no one left in the system to create change from the inside. There’s a big problem with that though because expecting people to stay comes at the expense of their peace and happiness all for the flimsy promise of “cultural change.”


## The Engineer’s Superiority Complex

One of the main ideas they both touched on was the Valley’s superiority complex (CS or nothing mentality) and distaste for business people (MBAs or sales).

Even in high school, there was also a very toxic expectation that everyone should know how to code. This mentality is a widespread personality type. It was honestly just a bunch of insecure (but intelligent) people that were power tripping over how many languages they could code “Hello World” in. 

A big west to east coast culture shock was how much the east coast people care about business. Business people are actually well respected over there. 

The engineer’s superiority complex is detrimental because it pressures people to become technical even though they might be more valuable without it. Business might not be as “hard” as engineering, but it’s harder to be a good business person than a good engineer. 

## Other Issues

- competitive environment / mental health
- housing crisis / homelessness / poverty
- fake “missions” (”The smartest people of my generation are working on getting people to click ads”-vibes)
- female representation: I don’t think this is fixed by lowering the standards for women or setting up quotas for female hires. That just creates negativity and leads to people making the conclusion that "she got here the easy way." (Also “Girlboss” should also never be used unironically.)

My Twitter feed is trashed with this, and I HATE IT. 

I also don’t understand why students in college who are just fellows at VC firms are giving advice to founders like they know what’s going on. It would be valid to share their experience and be like “I worked with X company, and here’s what happened.” They don’t do that. There are no specific examples or stories. It’s always “here’s what founders should really be doing” from some sophomore tech bro named David from UC Berkeley. There’s also the “day in the life of the Gen Z VC”. Then there are the “start up sprint” advice posts that glorify overworking yourself, sleeping on the floor, and eating shitty ramen everyday from people who are definitely NOT doing that.
