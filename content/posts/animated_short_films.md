I been watching these short animated videos on YouTube. Many of them are silent (no dialogue). They’re so well-made. Some made me cry. Some are more creepy, dystopian vibes with social commentary. It’s a whole movie experience in under 10 minutes.

### Made me cry

- [One Small Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9b3KgCBQE) (appreciate your silent supporters) ***hella tears
- [Umbrella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl1FOKpFY2Q) (have empathy for others)
- [Let’s Eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MX_fJAhmEE&t=44s) (Asian mother and daughter relationship)
- [Hair Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNw8V_Fkw28) (family)
- [WiNDUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efGqe1j3RNk) (hospitalization)
- [First Born](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLFIf7aXmk) (siblings)

### Dystopian

- [Best Friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j01Hg4QJ6NE) (addicted to a virtual friends product, themes of loneliness & addiction) ***only 5 minutes but 10/10 impact
- [Less Than Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp1paRWGYPY) (zombies but it’s cute)

### Funny

- [Yes-People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaTkL825NQM) (different meanings of “yes”)
- [Alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc-vINJmhNk)
- [All You Can Eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmN_OUgYd9k)

### Misc

- [The Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCawr8qHbHE) 
- [Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKLEeY_WeQ)
