Apparently, Google has reason to be concerned about TikTok. It’s pretty clear why Facebook feels threatened, but Google seems fine. Google+ died a long time ago. 

### Who is gloyo?

Google is worried about “gloyo,” which refers to global youth (defined as everyone under the age of 24). Gloyo is switching to TikTok to search for things like trends, travel, recipes, and instructions. Gloyo isn’t “excited” about Google search in the way that they are about TikTok. TikTok is cool and trendy and social. Google is just Google.

The effort threshold for Google Search is also too high for gloyo’s low attention spans. The effort required to read through multiple links and find something versus finding some guy w a 30 second video that curates it all for you. Not to mention the entertainment and social aspect of TikTok is much greater than Google’s. You are probably going to share, comment, and like a tok, but you don’t have that level of engagement with Google. 

### Google vs TikTok

TikTok [beat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/12/29/tiktok-surpasses-google-facebook-as-worlds-most-popular-web-destination/) Google as the most popular web domain of 2021 and had a higher average watch time per user than Youtube. These trends show that gloyo is consuming information in a different way that threatens Google and Youtube. For Google, more people searching on TikTok means less eyes for less time = less ads money. 

They are trying to do research on gloyo and their attitudes to try to supplement Google to catch up to the times without losing their existing users. These include Youtube’s introduction of Youtube shorts, and Google search being improved to give you the most relevant TikToks. It’s like how people search “[something] reddit” to get the best reddit thread, but instead you would be searching “best travel places tiktok.” 

Although TikTok dominates short-form videos, monetizing short-form videos is a huge challenge. 20 million views on TikTok is very different that 20 million views on Youtube. Shorts is doing [good](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/youtube-q1-earnings-2022-google/?cx_testId=6&cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s) apparently, and if anyone knows how to monetize videos, it’s Youtube. No one really can say who’s winning right now. 

### Opinions

I don’t think gloyo trusts TikTok in the same way that they trust Google for real information. I feel like it’s just known as “sus,” but people consume it anyways because it’s fun. For searching trends and fashion, TikTok is probably better, but for most other things, you literally need Google to take you to a website to do what you need to do. The experiences are just very different. I also think Shorts is really smart because I’ve caught myself scrolling through Shorts while browsing Youtube (aka I'm addicted). It’s very nicely integrated. 

The main thing to remember is that somewhere out there Google and Youtube execs are unironically saying “gloyo” every other sentence in a very serious and tense tone. 

*Gloyo* 🤒 😩

 
**EXTRA:** 

If you search “dog training” on mobile, it will trigger their early try for short video results (you have to scroll down).
