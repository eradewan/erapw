I signed an NDA, so I’m not going to talk about what I actually did. Just the vibes. I have a lot of random topics to cover. Some stuff is me speculating. Picture dump at the end.

## Corporate Small Talk

During my first few weeks, I really struggled with corporate small talk. It’s so boring. It’s so annoying. It’s so bland. Fake laughs and recycled topics. 10 times a day. Many conversations are high quality, but you have to pull them out.


## Range of People

There’s a huge range of people at Google. All of them are smart, but there are different types. By nature, the people are generally risk-averse. 

- **first job**: people in their early 20’s who got the job out of college and are just learning about the industry and trying to move up levels
    - ex. lots of people joined remotely, so they worked from Hawaii with their friends and had a great time during the pandemic
- **rest & vest**: self-explanatory
- **big tech jumpers**: I made this name up, but there’s like a squad of moms and dads (like 40+) that just have been jumping from company to company every 5-10 years
    - ex. an asian mom who was at HPE for 6 years, then Yahoo for 5 years, then Google for 9 years (numbers are off but yea)
- **experts by topic**: there are randomly very knowledgeable people everywhere
    - ex. like some guy on my team was on Google’s C++ committee and just knew everything, another guy was just really passionate about Rust, lots of other examples like that
- **lifetime googlers**: Some people have been here since early days, interesting to talk to them because they’re like dinosaurs with the history they know, think about how much the tech landscape has changed since they joined and they’ve been there for all of it
    - ex. my host's manager’s husband was part of the small team of engineers that integrated google into yahoo’s website

## Great Internal Tools (Good & Bad)

They have a lot of internal tools that are really high quality. They speed up a lot of common processes and also allow for greater control over whatever you’re trying to do. If you have an issue, you can literally ask the person that made the tool (or is maintaining it).

It’s also really slow though because sometimes tools have lots of layers of abstraction, which makes debugging really tedious. You don’t know if you did something wrong or some random layer of the thing is failing. It’s kind of hard to explain, but a lot of time was wasted on these stupid errors. 

Another issue with the internal tools is that Google is so big that people end up making lots of different versions of the same tool. They do have efforts to consolidate and standardize them, but copycats still exist. Maintaining a bunch of slightly different versions of the same thing seems like a waste of time and money. 


## Company Culture

Google’s culture is great. I love it. The amount of thought and effort that goes into their brand is amazing. Their internal vocabulary is so fun (“noogler,” “doogler,” “paroogler”). They are also consistent — like in all internal documentation and signage, they use noogler doogler consistently like normal words. There are a lot of them (and also acronyms), and there’s a glossary for it. 

They put thought into everything. Everything. Not just engineering. Their colors are everywhere. The offices have great design (apparently the google real estate team is great). This is random, but the breakfast granola is labelled “granoogle.” That’s so cute. The Google food team thinks about stuff like nutrition and how much caffeine to put into coffee to increase productivity. There are a lot of other examples, but the point is that everything is very well thought out. It’s all very cohesive and put together. 

Their standards are really high. Engineering is serious. Code reviews were kind of brutal, but they’re necessary. High standards is a point of pride. It’s not treated as something you can skip because it’s annoying and slow. It’s well respected and recognized as an important practice. I think it’s a good experience to be part of a company with a well-organized and well-maintained codebase with good documentation. I can imagine it can get messy really quickly at a startup or smaller company.

People are really nice. They genuinely are kind people. I didn’t feel any type of toxic competition. They give peer bonuses and kudos to each other all the time. People are really respectful even while delivering feedback and criticism. It’s a very professional atmosphere, but people are still friends. It was great. People unironically say “be googley” which is like “be nice” “don’t be stupid” “don’t be rude.” People also joke about it too, but when someone says it seriously, people take it seriously.  

All of this + more things I missed = you’re a “Googler.” It makes you feel like a part of a cult. I really believe that all successful cultures should be strong enough so you feel like part of a cult. Not too extreme though. Insiders should be proud of being on the inside, and outsiders should want to be part of the inside. That’s what makes the insiders feel like they’ve won.  

I didn’t want to include this up there with the good stuff, but I think the only negative might be that people are maybe a little too political for the workplace. I think Google encourages you to bring your “whole self” to work. Sometimes I feel like people want Google to take a stand on something that’s completely unrelated to what they’re doing. I think it’s unfair to expect Google to take responsibility to help solve every global problem or make their opinion clear on every political issue. 


## So Slow: Corporate Headwind

I learned this during my chat with Jackie Bernhelm, the director of Google’s in-house startup accelerator called Area120. She talked about how some international efforts were blocked because of some obscure laws that Google had to deal with before they could operate (vague af on purpose because some stuff was confidential). 

The basic idea is that the more entities involved in an effort, the slower things move. The term “corporate headwind” refers to this idea that the probability of success goes down exponentially with the number of collaborators. It’s definitely true. 

Externally it’s hard to avoid the number of collaborators. For example, if you want to start a business in India, you have to follow the Indian government’s laws and procedures. There’s really no way to cut them out. Internally you have more control, but it’s probably hard to justify cutting people. I imagine a lot of people are needed to build something from scratch and less people are needed to maintain it. How do you jusitfy cutting someone from their product when they’ve been there from the beginning? I feel like there’s also a culture of growing team size being a positive indicator, which I don’t think makes sense. There are diminishing returns. I guess it would be cool for a manager to have more reports. Team growth might also mean more progress in more projects. That’s probably where it comes from.

## SWE Led, Engineering First

Google is a SWE led organization. The respect for SWEs trumps everything else. If it came down to it, SWE’s opinion would overrule a PM’s decision at the same level (according to my mentor). With this culture, I would’ve thought intelligence would take you far in the organization, but it doesn’t. 

High EQ still wins. Being able to give a competent high level overview of technical things in lay mans terms (no jargon or abbreviations) is a highly valuable skill. The tech leads aren’t even the smartest people in the room - they’re the people who can run the meetings and extract insights out of the shit that engineers say. It’s insane how clear who the barrels are and who the ammunition is ([barrels and ammunition](https://review.firstround.com/Keith-Rabois-on-the-role-of-a-COO-how-to-hire-and-why-transparency-matters) is an idea by Keith Rabois). There are some really intelligent people with high potential, but they have no soft skills to propel their career. You really don’t need to be the smartest person in the room. You just need to have a smart person in the room, and you have to be able to understand and listen to them.

## Miscellaneous Things

- Food is really good!
- I got my first ever massage here and it was great - I also learned that tech workers contribute to the jaw clenching epidemic
- Some advice I got that I liked: *“My recommendation is to focus in on a goal. If you want to learn how startups function then focus on joining a startup. If you want to become really technical then imo a larger company can help - particularly a research team within a larger company. If you want to make guaranteed money then join a bigger company. But if you are willing to risk it for the chance at a unicorn, then you can join a startup. Just remember that they are called unicorns for a reason. So if you take away one thing from this, I would focus on a goal and make sure the team/company you join fulfills that goal.”*
- I love dooglers. (first doogler statue is in the photo dump below)
