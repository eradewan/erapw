One of the many random acronyms that I learned this summer was YAGNI. 

> 💡 **YAGNI**: “You aren’t gonna need it”

It’s used to describe features that aren’t really necessary for the product. You can add it if you want, but it’s not required. Honestly, my first thought after learning about YAGNI is that people need to use this more in daily life than for software development. We should question anything think we MUST do and NEED to have and SHOULD attend. Just YAGNI it. 

*You are required to attend some useless meeting? YAGNI.* 

*You have to take some hard finance class because all the bros are in it? YAGNI.*  

*You have to entertain someone that drains your energy? YAGNI.*

Here’s to YAGNI’ing the useless features of your life. LGTM.
