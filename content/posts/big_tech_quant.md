> **Disclaimer:** This is a (very uninformed) comparison between work life and ideology at big tech and quant companies. I don’t actually know how anything works. My sources are me, my twin brother, and a Jane Street recruiting event I went to. My Google mentor seemed to agreed with me. 


All the CS majors are having an existential crisis on whether to do quant or big tech. Which one is better? I don’t think they are even comparable. The idea of quant and big tech are based in completely two different ideologies. There’s no way you can subscribe to both unless you don’t care and are just chasing bread. Both are respectable. 

### quant

Quant vibes is coding against the market. The rules are set, and you’re trying to optimize algorithms to win. Be a market maker, and get those arbitrage opportunities. In general, the problems you solve are less variable and well defined. You don’t deal with dumb consumers that complain about random bugs or ask for obscure features. Nobody is really “using” your code. When you talk to SWEs at quant firms, they like it because it is the most technically challenging (coding and math wise). They think about algorithmic macro-strategies with help from traders. The stuff they think about is specific C++ things to optimize a trading simulation (like caching or speeding up linked lists and stuff). They have distribited systems libraries for this, which you use to implement whatever (like different types of orders, pricing, volume, etc.). Quant is coding in a vacuum, the only feedback you care about is how much money you made. 

### big tech

Big tech (on the product side) vibes is coding for users. The rules are not set, users are annoying as fuck, and everything is very variable. The only requirement is to get shit done for the user, but no one tells you how. There are also a lot of random things like migrations and refactoring. SWEs work with PMs to propose and design features and then work on implementing them. If a product is already built out, there’s also a lot of just maintenance of fixing bugs that users complain about. The engineers like it because they are coding for billions of people. When you talk to them, they say it's challenging to come up with the best design for the user, and it's cool to ship an actual product that's being used and then iterating to make it the best. The coding isn't as difficult as quant unless you're on some hardcore research team. 

There’s also a lot of flavors of SWE at big tech firms that focus on different product areas, so the experience is very team dependent. For example, the data team SWEs work in infrastructure, so they don’t even work with PMs. They are very engineering-focused so they design, implement, and ship new implementations of data management themselves. However, the overall sentiment that they like what they do because it serves billions of people is still there.

### my pref

I’m very biased but I would rather build a product at big tech company than optimize trading at a quant firm. I don’t really care about how to make a linked list run faster or designing trading algorithms. I would be down to read about their technical challenges and advances, and I would probably think it’s cool, but I don’t want to work on that. Kind of like research. 

For big tech, I don’t really care about the billions of people part because I think that’s just a feel-good thing they throw around. Someone said: “I removed 10 pixels of padding from search results, so people don’t have to scroll down as much to find what they want, so on aggregate I saved people years when they search on Google.” On one hand it is crazy that a small change can have a big impact, but on the other hand...they just changed the padding. That’s not very exciting. 

A lot of big tech is also maintaining or updating products that already exist, which I don’t find as interesting. I would rather be there from the beginning. Start with a new product idea, design it, think about the implementation, produce it, test it and run experiments, and then launch it. We’ll see what happens.
