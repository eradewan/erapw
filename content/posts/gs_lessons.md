I recently listened to Freakonomics episode “The Economics of Everyday Things: Girl Scout Cookies,” and it was crazy to listen to everything I’ve experienced as a podcast story. It was funny to me to hear the stories because the Girl Scout experience is truly universal. The “Cookie Mom” who kept the inventory, the competitive nature of cookie selling, watching people avoid eye contact when they exit a Safeway. I was a Girl Scout for 10 years, so I’ve experienced all of the above. I have a couple core memories that taught me some very important lessons and also helped shape my personality.

## **Always Ask**

My troop used to set up booths outside Safeway, the BART station, and other high traffic areas. We had the classic set up: a fold up table, some hand drawn posters with cartoon cookies, and bunch of boxes lined up in rows on the table. Back then, a box was $4, and we only took cash. There were 2 girls and a mom on shift at all times. Our only job was to sell. That meant asking: “Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?” The only acceptable answers were “Yes” or “I’m sorry I don’t have cash.” This makes me realize that excuse probably doesn’t even work anymore because troops probably take card, Venmo, and all of the above now.

I remember being really uncomfortable asking people that question. I think it was a combination of being shy and not wanting to disturb people. A lot of people made a huge effort to ignore us, so calling out to them seemed wrong. Also, some people didn’t reply to the question, and I personally (still) can’t handle awkward silences. It took me a while, but over time, I saw the pattern. If I asked, I scored. I remember asking one man and he didn’t even want cookies, but he donated $20 instead just to support the troop. By the end of my first selling season, I was looking every person coming out of those stores in the eye, smiling, and asking “Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?” 

## **The 80/20 rule**

In cookie selling, there are two cookies that reign supreme: samoas and thin mints. I remember being really confused on why we had so many flavors if two flavors made up most of our sales. It was an early example of Pareto Principle, 20% of the cookie flavors were contributing 80% of our sales.

Although I didn’t match this to the official framework until later, I recognized it and learned to focus my efforts on the 20%, which meant selling those two cookies like crazy. I would preorder just samoas and thin mints in bulk and only order other flavors only on request. 

## **Place is Important**

I think I was in 4th grade. I missed one Girl Scout meeting. During that meeting, my troop decided that we would be fundraising for the animal shelter by singing in front of my local farmer’s market and taking donations. I remember being so annoyed because I didn’t want to sing in public, and I thought the idea would never work. Realistically, I thought we wouldn’t make that much money by standing there for a couple hours and singing. We aren’t providing any value. In my mind, the way to fundraise was to sell a product and make profit (probably programmed by the cookie selling mindset). We stood there on Sunday morning with a box for donations. I remember singing Bruno Mars “Count on Me” in unison with my troop. Just 5 girls standing there with our printed sheet of lyrics. It was really hot, but there were a lot of people. We were probably there for 2 or 3 hours. Guess how much we made.

We made over $500. I was so shocked. I remember my troop leader explaining: “It’s the farmer’s market. Everyone has cash left over. What are they going do with it?” And that’s when I realized the strategy. Place is important. The fact that we were in the farmer’s market meant that we had unique access to a bunch of people walking around with spare change. They probably don’t wanna carry it, and they can feel good by giving it to us. And what other way to get their attention and advertise that we’re accepting money than to be really loud and sing? Genius. It just expanded my view of how to think about the environment and ecosystem where things take place.

These were just a few lessons, but Girl Scouts taught me so much more. It holds a special place in my heart because it was a huge part of my life for a long time, and I was (and still am) proud to be a Girl Scout. Since my high school environment wasn’t really conducive to having teachers as mentors (they were more like tormenters), my Girl Scout troop leaders filled that gap for me. They were powerful influences and incredibly supportive. I wouldn’t be who I am today without the Girl Scouts. Shout out to them.
