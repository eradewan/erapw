## Why do promising technological innovations fail to create value?
 
The challenge of technology entrepreneurship and firms is not so much coming up with great ideas or recognizing technological trends. The challenge is the **commercialization** the technology and create unique value for the customer.

 

Below are the stories of great ideas and technologies failed commercially.

### Segway

The Segway PT is a two-wheeled self-balancing battery electric vehicle launched in 2001. Although the parent company Segway Inc. was well funded and the product was met with a blizzard of publicity, the Segway failed to gain significant market acceptance. The question is: Why?


1. **Media’s High Expectations:** The media set high expectations for the Segway calling it the greatest innovation since the personal computer and the future of transportation. 
2. **Social Factors:** The design of the Segway was also ridiculed for looking dorky and gave off more “mall cop in his mid-40s” vibes than a cool, sleek ride. 
3. **Invention**: The Segway was invented in isolation without customer feedback or criticism. It was an patented invention and it worked well, but who really wanted to use it?
4. **Infrastructure:** The Segway didn’t have charging or parking infrastructure. There was also confusion on whether it was meant for the sidewalk or the road. There was no support for consumers to use the Segway at all. 
5. **Regulations:** The Segway was banned from sidewalks and roads in a lot of countries because it did not fit any of the existing categories for mobile vehicles. 

The modern-day equivalent of the Segway that I think solved all these problems are the city scooter brands like [Lime](https://www.li.me/about-us) and [Bird](https://www.bird.co/). They had a media backing and were adopted by the youth (as they were introduced in major urban cities near college campuses). The scooters are small, light, and easy to learn to use. They’re paired with mobile apps, and the scooters can be parked easily anywhere on the sidewalk. They either have charging stations or employees that pick scooters up off the streets and charge them. Right now, e-scooters are street-legal in more than 35 states. E-scooter companies have effectively done what Segway could not. 

### Transmeta

Transmeta made the Crusoe, a chip that was meant for small devices. It conserved battery life and reduced heat with full Intel compatibility. Transmeta had their IPO on November 2000, and it opened at \$21 a share before peaking at 50.26 and ending the day at 46. This type of performance wouldn’t be surpassed until Google’s IPO in 2004. Transmeta was riding a high until it crashed and burned. 

- Recessions: Japan had proven to be a strong market for the small, battery-life critical devices Transmeta had in min, but Japan hit a then-record 5% unemployment rate. The US followed shortly after with NASDAQ had starting going down (and it would go on to lose 78% of its value).
- Transmeta had horrible execution, and Intel absolutely crushed them:
    - **Quality:** Three weeks after Transmeta’s IPO NEC announced a recall of 300 Crusoe powered chips, and Sony had to announce that their Crusoe powered laptops would be affected.
    - **Time to Market:** By the time Crusoe chip shipped, Intel had already promoted a new life of energy-efficient processors, releasing a low-power Pentium III chip and then in 2003 launching their Pentium M processor.

Some other examples and cases include:

- The “Xerox” Problem
- The “Nokia” Problem
- MySpace v. Facebook
- Garmin v. Google Maps
