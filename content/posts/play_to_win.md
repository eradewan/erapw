## Leadership Culture: How do you play?

In Corporate Valuations, we went over three philosophies to lead by: play to win, play for the sake of playing, play to survive.

It reminded me of a question that someone asked at a forum:


> ❓ For the last few years Google seems to be playing catch, be it on YouTube (catching up to TikTok) or Cloud (AWS/Azure) or Pixel / Wearables (Apple) and as  we do that we are losing ground to new innovations. What is our strategy to go

Playing to win or playing to defend - and how do you change from one to the other? A decade ago, it seemed like big tech was playing to win. Google was once a market leader that everyone looked up to and couldn’t hope to reach. Now, they’re playing catch up in multiple categories including their main core competency of search. Over time, they went from playing to win to playing to survive. They’ve lost their culture of innovation and leading from the front and switched to copycat culture in attempt to catch up to shiny newcomers. 

## In Life: Playin to Win

These leadership principles can be applied to life. 

As a competitive person, I usually play to win if a contest is involved. What’s the point if we’re not playing to win? If we’re doing a competition, we should set our sights on winning. I think this mindset has helped me strive to do the best. In contrast, you can play to play. I feel like this personality is limiting. I don’t think people intentionally play to play. It’s the type of people who don’t believe they can win or don’t aim for winning. They end up being so restricted by their own self-imposed handicaps that they’ve lost before they’ve even started. Another type of person that plays to play is someone who is playing to win a different game than they’re playing. An example I can think of is Super Smash Bros. You can pick Kirby. The strategy is to fly above the other character and keep avoiding them. Your opponent will keep trying to hit you, but they can’t. They do really difficult combos and moves and then eventually they die in a dumb way like falling off the edge while trying to chase Kirby. Then they’re pissed because they think you “didn’t actually play.” Long story but point is — this player is playing to play because they have some extra rules in their head that make them play a different game than the one they’re actually playing. They believe you only win if you play a certain way, but that isn’t true. 

On the other hand, is playing to win a fancy disguise for playing to burnout? Does everything really have to be a competition? Can you just enjoy the journey and where it takes you without worrying about the results? Another consideration is what is the focus in each play. Playing to win means your focus is moving forward - how do I get better? Playing to survive means your focus is not moving backwards - how do you do just enough to stay in the game? Playing for the sake of playing - do you even have a direction? Most people would rather look forward than constantly fear falling behind, and many would rather have a direction than no direction.

I think the answer is to pick one based on what you’re doing, but I do think it’s interesting to think about spheres of life we might be playing to play, but we should be playing to win and vice versa.
