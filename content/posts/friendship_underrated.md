I feel like we celebrate and appreciate romantic relationships a lot, but friendships are just taken for granted. I think having solid friendships is as important (arguably even more) important than a romantic relationship. They last longer, they’re more stable, and they’re comfortable. 

Good friends support you in a unique, unconditional way. They are reliable and constant. They root for your success in such a healthy way. I don’t know what I’d do without the friends I’ve made throughout my life. 

The way I approach friendship — I want my friends to feel like being friends with me is so special that it’s a privilege. Not sure if they think that because I mostly just get shit on. 

Here are some “true friendship” stories that I’ve come across. I love these stories, and they inspire me to be a good friend (only to some special people!). 

### Kafka & Brod

Franz Kafka was a short story writer and a literary genius. You may know the word “kafkaesque” based on his name. It’s used to describe bureaucracy because he has [some story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis) about a guy who wakes up transformed into a bug.

Max Brod was a prolific writer, but above all he’s remembered as Kafka’s friend.

They met at the end of their first year of law studies. Their story is scrambled throughout [Kafka’s wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka).

Here are my highlights: 

- Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humor with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice.
- Kafka dedicated his first published book to Brod, "Für M.B.", and added in the personal copy given to his friend "So wie es hier schon gedruckt ist, für meinen liebsten Max‍—‌Franz K." ("As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max").
- Brod often convinced Kafka to publish his writing. When Kafka died, he left his work to Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka's death. He said:
    
    > Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.
    > 
    
    Brod ignored this request (Brod reallly ignored his death wish because Kafka was still being stubborn) and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. Brod finished many of Kafka's incomplete works for publication (rearranged chapters, copy-edited the text, and changed the punctuation). 
    
- Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the "century of Kafka”

Kafka's work has influenced a vast range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers during the 20th and 21st centuries. His work would’ve never seen the light of day if it wasn’t for Brod. 

### Oprah & Gayle

Watch this [Oprah's 2020 Vision Tour Visionaries: Gayle King Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klSFIzM6Ar8) AND [Oprah on her frienship with Gayle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vWegVQYMkQ)

Oprah and Gayle have been friends since they were 21 and 22. They have such a tight bond, and their chemistry is undeniable. Despite Oprah’s success, Gayle has never been jealous and has celebrated her victories and vice versa. Their friendship is now 46 years long.

> When she was making 50 an hour, I was making 27. Somebody said, 'Do you ever feel lesser?’ And I go, 'No, it's not a friendship based on money.' I never feel like I'm competing. I never feel lesser than.

Behind every successful person there stands their best friend.
