Annie Duke, the author of Quit and award winning poker player, came to Wharton to talk about quitting. She used poker as an analogy for making quitting decisions. The best poker players aren’t the ones who know what hand to play, they’re the ones that know when to fold. 

### Quit Framework

Should I quit? I’ve faced this dilemma a lot. Annie Duke gives a framework to tackle this. Grit is sticking to hard things that are worthwhile. We often have a strong bias against quitting and rationalize not quitting by citing grit. However, the key word is ***worthwhile***. Is it worthwhile? The next question to ask: how long can I endure this? Here you can set a kill switch (“I’ll quit after 2 months”). Then, get help on the decision from a verified mentor, someone who’s not too invested. This framework helps you get unstuck and check if you’re quitting for the wrong reasons.

### Family as Flawed Mentors

Duke said that parents aren’t good mentors because they are too invested in you. A real mentor wouldn’t care whether you quit or not. These are the people tell you the truth and can check your decision making. I realize that I can credit my success to some of my old friends who have been acting as my mentors. Although we don’t talk everyday, we can share professional and personal crises and count on getting an unfiltered opinion. The exchange of crisis is essential. Not because our friendship is conditional but rather no one person feels like a burden or a therapist. I also feel like it helps that we know each other well but aren’t involved in each other’s daily lives. Guidance from a distant bird’s eye view is better. 

### Resulting

Another point I really liked was her note on how we judge the aftermath of quitting. She calls the act of judging choices by the outcomes we get “resulting.” The outcome shouldn’t be a metric of the quality of the decision because there are factors of luck and hidden information that affect it. In the same way, Duke says you can’t judge a poker player by their victory. You can only know who played best if you see the hands they were dealt and their reactions to them. In the same way, decisions are made based on the information you had at the time and should not be judged by the result. The reason why we do this is because decisions then become very difficult to measure. Outcomes are easy to see and tangible. If outcomes aren’t the metric, how do we know what a good decision is? In any case, Duke’s advice to avoid resulting stuck to me. Many times I find myself saying “I shouldn’t have done Y because now X happened, so in the future I won’t do Y.” Now, I realize that I could’ve never foreseen X. I should trust that I made the right decision with the information I had at the time of Y.

### Omission Commission Bias and the Regret Problem

Omission is the idea that it’s easier to not do anything. There’s no active decision being made by staying on the path you’re already on. Commission is the idea that switching is an “active” choice, so we perceive it as a new choice. In reality, every day we choose to be on the same path is also a new choice.

This leads to the regret problem. The first part of the regret problem is sunk cost. We tend to stay where we are because we fear that switching might also lead to something bad. Duke says this is a probability game. There’s a 100% chance your current situation is horrible, and there’s a 50% chance the new place is horrible. Which one would you choose? If the new place turns out to be horrible, that doesn’t make the decision bad because that’s resulting. The second part is loss aversion, the idea that we are tolerant of bad actions we’re already in and intolerant of switching out of them. 

### Monkeys and Pedestals

Duke ended with a mental model: monkey and pedestals. This one is really great. Let’s say you are a circus owner and you want to add a new attraction of a monkey that juggles flaming hot torches on a pedestal: Don’t build the pedestal first. Train the monkey first.

An example is the plan to build the tracks for the CA Bullet Train from SF to LA. The tracks on flat land were approved first (pedestal). Once these were built, organizers realized that there were 2 mountain ranges that were seismically active (they were always there). The technology to build tracks in those areas wasn’t proven (monkey). Gavin Newsom said we can’t quit now because we can’t waste tax payers money (sunk cost). They continued to inflate the budget and waste money on something that wasn’t possible.

Building the pedestal requires effort and money, creating the illusion of progress. After you build it, it’s a sunk cost. The trained monkey is the real bottleneck of the system and should be addressed first. They should’ve worked on the technology to build railways through the mountain ranges first before approving the flat tracks. 

### Question

I had a question after this talk. We talked a lot about what to do if you’re thinking of quitting. What if people are telling you to quit but you aren’t even thinking of it? How can you verify that your stickiness is grit and not delusion? I couldn’t ask her because there was no open Q&A, but it’s something to think about.
