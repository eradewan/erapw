> The Expectations Treadmill illustrates the high performance expectations built into a company's share price. On a broader level, it represents the ongoing race we have to continuously improve. Is this the game we want to play? 


## What is the Expectations Treadmill?

In class, we did an exercise on calculating total shareholder value based on the performance of a company. The take away was that the value isn’t even based on the performance. Value is based on expectations. Once you reach a certain level of performance, that performance gets encoded as an expectation in the share price. This creates an endless game where you can only win if you raise the expectations. Every time you perform at a high level, that performance gets built into the share price, and the only way to do better is beat it by raising the expectations. This is the idea of the expectations treadmill. The speed of a treadmill represents the expectations built into a company's share price. Once you reach a speed, the only way to do better is to run faster.

## Is this the game we want to play?

My professor told a story. The first CEO continues to beat expectations until they reach a point of plateau, then they retire. They are celebrated as the best CEO. They caused the highest growth period. The second CEO who takes over can’t beat the high expectations set for his company. The company’s value plummets. The board fires the CEO. The expectations are now on the floor. The third CEO comes in. The expectations are low and can be raised again to the level they were once at with the first CEO. This CEO is regarded as the comeback CEO. Someone who took a broken company and fixed it. 

The first and third CEO’s didn’t really do anything special. They raised expectations from low to higher level. Unless they beat a level of record high expectation that had been set before, they didn’t really revolutionize the company. That would actually be impressive. The second CEO is the victim of the brutal game — left with the impossible task of stretching the limits of expectations, he was bound to be regarded as a failure. 

The question becomes: Is this the game we want to play? The endless expectations treadmill is the game of corporate strategy and business. My professor decided no. He’d rather help other people analyze the game, but he didn’t want to play. He’s happy doing research in the basement of Wharton. I personally think it would be fun to play for a while. We’ll see.

## The Expectations Treadmill in Life: Hedonic Treadmill

We have the expectations treadmill in life, not just corporate valuations. I feel like every time I reach a point of high performance, it raises my expectation and becomes the new bar I set for myself. On one hand, it’s good because the Pygmalion effect says having high expectations improves our behavior and therefore our performance in a given area. It suggests that we do better when more is expected of us. On the other hand, the pressure compounds to stay at that level and achieve something better every single time. 

The rush of winning only lasts a few seconds and then it’s on to something bigger and better. A related idea is the hedonic treadmill, a theory that says people repeatedly return to their baseline level of happiness, regardless of what happens to them. 

The question then becomes: How do we pursue happiness and satisfaction without falling off the treadmill and dying a unsatisfied, depressed soul? The internet says “practice loving-kindness meditation to help dismantle false assumptions about what leads to happiness and wellbeing.” 

It’s a work in progress. I’m not going to meditate. I think being aware of the treadmill and checking our my expectations for myself helps overcome the sadness and depression associated with self-disappointment and may help me be kinder to myself.
