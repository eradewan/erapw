    <description><![CDATA[I recently listened to Freakonomics episode “The Economics of Everyday Things: Girl Scout Cookies,” and it was crazy to listen to everything I’ve experienced as a podcast story. It was funny to me to hear the stories because the Girl Scout experience is truly universal. The “Cookie Mom” who kept the inventory, the competitive nature of cookie selling, watching people avoid eye contact when they exit a Safeway. I was a Girl Scout for 10 years, so I’ve experienced all of the above.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The Expectations Treadmill illustrates the high performance expectations built into a company&rsquo;s share price. On a broader level, it represents the ongoing race we have to continuously improve. Is this the game we want to play?
What is the Expectations Treadmill? In class, we did an exercise on calculating total shareholder value based on the performance of a company. The take away was that the value isn’t even based on the performance.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Annie Duke, the author of Quit and award winning poker player, came to Wharton to talk about quitting. She used poker as an analogy for making quitting decisions. The best poker players aren’t the ones who know what hand to play, they’re the ones that know when to fold.
Quit Framework Should I quit? I’ve faced this dilemma a lot. Annie Duke gives a framework to tackle this. Grit is sticking to hard things that are worthwhile.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I wrote some random reflections and some observations of my time at MIT on the plane back from Boston. I was only there for 3 days, so these are first impressions.
me and kathy MIT Culture Good things The MIT vocabulary goes strong: psets, hosed, numbers for everything (majors &amp; buildings). You know a culture is strong when conversations are complete gibberish to people outside. It’s so funny to see the same things at your university but branded slightly different (MIT Police, MIT Hillel, MIT SAAS, etc).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Leadership Culture: How do you play? In Corporate Valuations, we went over three philosophies to lead by: play to win, play for the sake of playing, play to survive.
It reminded me of a question that someone asked at a forum:
❓ For the last few years Google seems to be playing catch, be it on YouTube (catching up to TikTok) or Cloud (AWS/Azure) or Pixel / Wearables (Apple) and as we do that we are losing ground to new innovations.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Ignore the cringe title, but I noticed a similarity in FNCE207 (Corporate Valuations) and CIS320 (Algorithms) during the first week of school.
FNCE207: Creating a Distinctive Advantage Through Choice In 207, we were talking about creating a distinctive advantage through choice. The case study was about how parents are skipping proper car seats in ride-shares like Uber.
🎯 The question was: should Uber invest to install car seats in cars?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Disclaimer: This is a (very uninformed) comparison between work life and ideology at big tech and quant companies. I don’t actually know how anything works. My sources are me, my twin brother, and a Jane Street recruiting event I went to. My Google mentor seemed to agreed with me.
All the CS majors are having an existential crisis on whether to do quant or big tech. Which one is better?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I feel like we celebrate and appreciate romantic relationships a lot, but friendships are just taken for granted. I think having solid friendships is as important (arguably even more) important than a romantic relationship. They last longer, they’re more stable, and they’re comfortable.
Good friends support you in a unique, unconditional way. They are reliable and constant. They root for your success in such a healthy way. I don’t know what I’d do without the friends I’ve made throughout my life.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I been watching these short animated videos on YouTube. Many of them are silent (no dialogue). They’re so well-made. Some made me cry. Some are more creepy, dystopian vibes with social commentary. It’s a whole movie experience in under 10 minutes.
Made me cry One Small Step (appreciate your silent supporters) ***hella tears Umbrella (have empathy for others) Let’s Eat (Asian mother and daughter relationship) Hair Love (family) WiNDUP (hospitalization) First Born (siblings) Dystopian Best Friend (addicted to a virtual friends product, themes of loneliness &amp; addiction) ***only 5 minutes but 10/10 impact Less Than Human (zombies but it’s cute) Funny Yes-People (different meanings of “yes”) Alarm All You Can Eat Misc The Twins Destiny ]]></description>

    <title>YAGNI but for life</title>

    <description><![CDATA[One of the many random acronyms that I learned this summer was YAGNI.
💡 YAGNI: “You aren’t gonna need it”
It’s used to describe features that aren’t really necessary for the product. You can add it if you want, but it’s not required. Honestly, my first thought after learning about YAGNI is that people need to use this more in daily life than for software development. We should question anything think we MUST do and NEED to have and SHOULD attend.]]></description>
