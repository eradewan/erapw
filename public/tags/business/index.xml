    <description><![CDATA[I recently listened to Freakonomics episode ‚ÄúThe Economics of Everyday Things: Girl Scout Cookies,‚Äù and it was crazy to listen to everything I‚Äôve experienced as a podcast story. It was funny to me to hear the stories because the Girl Scout experience is truly universal. The ‚ÄúCookie Mom‚Äù who kept the inventory, the competitive nature of cookie selling, watching people avoid eye contact when they exit a Safeway. I was a Girl Scout for 10 years, so I‚Äôve experienced all of the above.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The Expectations Treadmill illustrates the high performance expectations built into a company&rsquo;s share price. On a broader level, it represents the ongoing race we have to continuously improve. Is this the game we want to play?
What is the Expectations Treadmill? In class, we did an exercise on calculating total shareholder value based on the performance of a company. The take away was that the value isn‚Äôt even based on the performance.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Leadership Culture: How do you play? In Corporate Valuations, we went over three philosophies to lead by: play to win, play for the sake of playing, play to survive.
It reminded me of a question that someone asked at a forum:
‚ùì For the last few years Google seems to be playing catch, be it on YouTube (catching up to TikTok) or Cloud (AWS/Azure) or Pixel / Wearables (Apple) and as we do that we are losing ground to new innovations.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Ignore the cringe title, but I noticed a similarity in FNCE207 (Corporate Valuations) and CIS320 (Algorithms) during the first week of school.
FNCE207: Creating a Distinctive Advantage Through Choice In 207, we were talking about creating a distinctive advantage through choice. The case study was about how parents are skipping proper car seats in ride-shares like Uber.
üéØ The question was: should Uber invest to install car seats in cars?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Apparently, Google has reason to be concerned about TikTok. It‚Äôs pretty clear why Facebook feels threatened, but Google seems fine. Google+ died a long time ago.
Who is gloyo? Google is worried about ‚Äúgloyo,‚Äù which refers to global youth (defined as everyone under the age of 24). Gloyo is switching to TikTok to search for things like trends, travel, recipes, and instructions. Gloyo isn‚Äôt ‚Äúexcited‚Äù about Google search in the way that they are about TikTok.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Note from the author: This is adapted from MGMT237: Management of Technology Notes. I wrote this during the first week of Spring 2022 semester.
